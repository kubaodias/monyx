# Monio

A shared household budget app for one family. Native Android, backend on Telnyx
Edge Compute. English and Polish interface, switchable in Settings.

## Layout

```
monio/
├── server/          Telnyx Edge Compute function (TypeScript)
├── android/         The app (Kotlin, Compose, Room)
├── scripts/         One-off operational scripts
└── docs/decisions/  ADRs — written when something surprised us
```

## Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 22.5 (for `node:sqlite` and `node --test`)
- `telnyx-edge` CLI ≥ 0.5.0 — below that the `sqldb` surface differs
- JDK 17+ and the Android SDK (platform 35, build-tools 35) for the app

## Server

```sh
cd server
npm install
npm test          # 44 tests: the sync protocol and the budget alert path
npm run typecheck
telnyx-edge ship  # deploy
```

Bindings live in `telnyx.toml` and are read via
`import { env } from "@telnyx/edge-runtime"` — **never** off the second argument
to `fetch(req, env)`, which type-checks cleanly and is `undefined` at runtime.

### Schema changes

Migrations are numbered and untouchable once applied. A fix is a **new file**,
never an edit to an old one.

```sh
telnyx-edge storage sqldb migrations apply monio --remote --migrations-dir server/migrations
```

### Creating a household

There is no endpoint that creates a household — enrolment consumes an invite, it
does not bootstrap. Use the script, which seeds the default categories and
accounts and mints the first invite code in one go:

```sh
node scripts/new-household.mjs "Dom"            # Polish seed names
node scripts/new-household.mjs "Home" --lang en  # English seed names
```

`--lang` picks the language of the SEED ROWS only, and only once. Category and
account names are data that syncs to every device; the in-app language picker
changes the interface around them, not the names themselves. That is deliberate
— the family renames these anyway, and a rename must not be undone by somebody
else switching language.

It prints the `household_id` and an invite code valid for 24 hours. Type that
code into the app's onboarding screen. After that, any enrolled phone can mint
further invites from Settings.

## Android

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug     # use the wrapper: it pins Gradle 8.11.1, and
                            # AGP 8.7.3 does not support Gradle 9
./gradlew assembleRelease   # signed, R8-minified, shrinkResources on
```

Debug builds carry `applicationIdSuffix ".debug"` so a debug and a release build
coexist on one phone. Without it the eventual release install fails with
`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, and the only way through is an uninstall
that destroys local data.

`versionCode` is derived from `git rev-list --count HEAD`. **Android refuses any
APK whose versionCode is lower than the installed one**, so a bad release cannot
be rolled back without an uninstall. Settings shows `versionName (versionCode)`
so "which build do you have?" is answerable over the phone.

### The release keystore

`android/keystore.properties` (git-ignored) points at `~/.monio/monio-release.jks`.

**Back up both the keystore and its password somewhere that survives a laptop
dying.** Android refuses an update signed with a different key than the installed
build. Losing the keystore means every phone must uninstall and reinstall,
losing anything not yet synced.

## Languages

English is the source and the default (`res/values/`); Polish is a translation
(`res/values-pl/`). Settings › Language offers System default, English, Polski.

Adding a language means three places, and missing any one of them fails quietly
in a different way:

1. `res/values-<tag>/strings.xml` — miss it and the language cannot be shown.
2. `res/xml/locales_config.xml` — miss it and Android's own per-app language
   list will not offer it.
3. `Locales.SUPPORTED` in `android/app/src/main/java/com/monio/Locales.kt` —
   miss it and the in-app picker will not list it.

Selection goes through `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales`, not a
preference of our own. On API 33+ that forwards to the framework `LocaleManager`
so the choice also appears in system settings; below 33 AppCompat stores it
itself, which is what the `autoStoreLocales` meta-data in the manifest switches
on. This is why `MainActivity` is an `AppCompatActivity` and the XML theme
parent is an AppCompat one — a plain `ComponentActivity` would store the
preference and then ignore it.

**Money and dates follow the interface language; the currency and the timezone
do not.** Polish prints `5 127,00 zł` (non-breaking space, comma decimal),
English `5,127.00 zł`. But złoty is złoty in both, and `Dates.ZONE` stays
`Europe/Warsaw` because that is where the household lives, not what it reads.
The formatters in `Money.kt` are cached against the locale that built them
rather than held in a `val`: switching language does not restart the process,
and a formatter built at class-init would keep printing the old language.

## Scheduling and backup

Nothing in this repository runs on a schedule. `POST /cron/daily` exists and is
guarded by the `CRON_SECRET` secret; it sweeps the budget alerts the push path
cannot see — a month boundary, a limit revised downward, a delivery that failed
while a phone was offline. Something outside the function has to call it, and
today nothing does.

Backups are manual for a harder reason: `sqldb export` is CLI-only, with no REST
equivalent, so the function cannot dump its own database.

```sh
telnyx-edge storage sqldb export monio --remote --output monio-$(date -u +%Y%m%d).sql
curl -X POST "$MONIO_API_URL/cron/daily" \
  -H "x-cron-secret: $CRON_SECRET" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"last_backup_at\": $(date -u +%s)000}"
```

Reporting `last_backup_at` is what makes a missed backup visible: the app reads
it and Settings warns when it is more than three days old. An invisible backup
is not a backup.

**Do not treat the phones as the backup.** `epoch` and the `households` row live
on the server, so if the database is lost no phone can authenticate to re-upload
its replica. The data survives locally, but recovery means seeding a fresh
household and re-enrolling every device by hand.

## Restore runbook

The middle step is why `epoch` exists. Skipping it is worse than not restoring
at all: `next_seq` rewinds below every device's cursor, all four phones pull
nothing forever, and the household silently splits into four divergent
single-user apps while every screen still looks perfectly normal.

1. **Restore the export.** A SQL script over `execute --remote --file` is capped
   at roughly 4 MiB, so split a large dump into chunks:
   ```sh
   node scripts/restore.mjs backups/monio-YYYYMMDD.sql
   ```
2. **Bump the epoch.** Every device notices on its next pull, resets its cursor
   and re-pulls from scratch.
   ```sh
   telnyx-edge storage sqldb execute monio --remote \
     --command "UPDATE households SET epoch = epoch + 1 WHERE id = ?" --param <household_id>
   ```
3. **Ask ONE recently-online phone** to tap *Re-upload everything* /
   *Wyślij wszystko ponownie* in Settings. Whatever the restore lost is still on the phones; this is what sends
   it back. One phone covers everything — asking all four means four times the
   pushes serialising on the same `households` row and every phone then pulling
   four redundant copies of every row. Ask a second phone only if rows are still
   missing.

Test this with two phones already syncing, against a realistically sized dump —
not ten rows against a fresh install. The `epoch` failure only appears when live
cursors exist, and the 4 MiB ceiling only appears at real size.

## What is deliberately not here

No multiple currencies, no debts or savings goals, no bank integration, no
Excel export, no iOS, no web.
